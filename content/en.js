      },
      {
        "question": "Do I have to simulate a course to use the app?",
        "answer": "No. PowerTread can run in Passive mode, where it records your session data and automatically adjusts power meter readings based on the treadmill\u2019s current incline. If you control incline manually on the treadmill, a single Bluetooth connection is enough. Two Bluetooth connections are only needed when another app, such as Zwift, is controlling incline while PowerTread is connected to read incline and record data."
