        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm text-center mb-8">Last Updated: July 9, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the PowerTread mobile application (the "App"), provided by NoVa Solutions Group, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), handles your information. Your privacy is a top priority, and we want to be transparent about how your data is managed.</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection by NoVa Solutions Group</h2>
        <p><strong>PowerTread is designed to operate without collecting any personal data from your device and sending it to NoVa Solutions Group. We do not collect, transmit, store, or have access to your personal information, workout activities, or any data generated within the App on our servers.</strong> All your data remains exclusively on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Processed On Your Device</h2>
        <p>The App processes various types of information *locally on your device* to provide its functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GPX Course Data:</strong> When you load GPX course files into the App, these files and the data contained within them (e.g., elevation profiles, coordinates) are processed locally on your device to simulate courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Treadmill and Sensor Data:</strong> The App connects to FTMS-compatible treadmills and other Bluetooth sensors. It collects data from these sensors *on your device*, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Treadmill incline/elevation changes</li>
                    <li>Running power data (from Stryd or other running power meters)</li>
                    <li>Speed, distance, cadence (from connected devices)</li>
                    <li>Heart rate (if connected via a compatible sensor)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> The App processes and stores data related to your workouts *on your device*, such as start and end times, duration, average metrics (pace, power, incline), and course progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> The App may access information about your mobile device *locally* for its operation, such as the device model and operating system version, but this information is not transmitted to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> The App may process anonymous, non-identifiable usage data *locally on your device* to understand general feature usage and improve performance, but this data is not linked to you personally or sent to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> While the App uses GPX data for course simulation, it does not track your real-world GPS location.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How the App Uses Information (On Device)</h2>
        <p>The App uses the information processed *on your device* for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App's functionalities, including GPX course simulation and treadmill control.</li>
            <li>To display your running metrics (e.g., power, pace, incline) during workouts.</li>
            <li>To record and summarize your workout activities within the App for your personal review.</li>
            <li>To generate and save a .FIT file of your workout on your local device that you can analyze as needed.</li>
            <li>To record and share your workout .FIT files with authorized 3rd party services such as Strava.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Sharing Your Information (User-Initiated Third-Party Sync)</h2>
        <p>Your personal workout data is not shared by PowerTread (NoVa Solutions Group) with any third parties. The only way your data leaves your device is through *your explicit action*:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optional Third-Party Integrations:</strong> The App may offer optional features to connect with and sync your activity data directly from your device to third-party fitness platforms (e.g., Strava). These integrations are entirely opt-in and require your explicit authorization within the App.
                <ul>
                    <li>When you authorize a connection, data will be shared directly between your device and the selected third-party service, subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies.</li>
                    <li>You are in full control of authorizing and deactivating these connections at any time within the App's settings.</li>
                    <li>We are not responsible for the data practices of these third-party services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security (On Device)</h2>
        <p>Since your data resides on your device, its security is primarily dependent on the security of your device and the operating system's protections. We design the App to handle data securely within the device's environment. We encourage you to use strong passwords and security features on your mobile device.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data, your control over your data is primarily exercised through your device's settings and the App's features. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manage or delete workout data stored locally on your device within the App.</li>
            <li>Control permissions for device features (e.g., Bluetooth) via your operating system settings.</li>
            <li>Authorize or deactivate third-party integrations at any time within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., for support documentation or compatible devices). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or services you visit.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been inadvertently processed on a device, we would recommend steps for the user to delete such information from their device.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
